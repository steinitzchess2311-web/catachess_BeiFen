"""
Opening Central Pawn Move tag detector.

Detects when a player pushes a central pawn (d4, e4, d5, e5) during the
opening phase of the game.

Conditions:
- Move is a pawn move
- Destination is d4, e4, d5, or e5
- Fullmove number <= 15
- At least 28 pieces on board (minimal early trades allowed)

Evidence:
- destination_square: The square the pawn moved to
- fullmove_number: Move number in the game
- piece_count: Number of pieces on board
