"""
Control over Dynamics (CoD) helper functions.

Provides control metrics computation and gating functions used by CoD detectors.
These functions measure position control, tension, mobility restrictions, and
volatility changes that indicate control-oriented play.

Note: This is a simplified version extracting only the essential functions
from the legacy control_helpers.py (which is 400+ lines). More functions
can be added as needed when implementing specific CoD subtypes.
