Prophylaxis detection helpers.

This module provides helper functions for detecting prophylactic moves -
anticipatory moves that prevent opponent threats or restrict opponent play.

Key concepts:
- Prophylaxis is anticipatory, not reactive (no captures, checks, or responses to check)
- Preventive score: measures opponent restriction (mobility drop, tactics drop, threat reduction)
- Soft weight: measures positional consolidation (structure, king safety)
- Pattern support: canonical prophylaxis motifs (bishop retreat, knight reposition, etc.)

Functions:
- is_prophylaxis_candidate(): Gate to check eligibility
- compute_preventive_score(): Compute opponent restriction score
- compute_soft_weight(): Compute positional consolidation score
- prophylaxis_pattern_reason(): Detect canonical motifs
- is_full_material(): Check if all 32 pieces remain

    Heuristic gate to decide whether a move is eligible for prophylaxis tagging.
