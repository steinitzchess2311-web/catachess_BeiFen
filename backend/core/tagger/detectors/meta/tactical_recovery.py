"""
Tactical Recovery tag detector.

Detects when a player recovers from a near-losing position through a
tactical move that significantly improves the evaluation.

Conditions:
- eval_before <= -3.0 pawns (near loss)
- eval_played >= -1.0 pawns (recovered to manageable position)

Evidence:
- eval_before: Evaluation before the move
- eval_played: Evaluation after the move
- recovery_amount: How much evaluation improved
