"""
Tactical Sensitivity tag detector.

Detects when a position has high tactical complexity, indicating that
accurate calculation is critical and small differences in moves can lead
to large evaluation swings.

Condition:
- tactical_weight > TACTICAL_THRESHOLD (typically 0.15)

Evidence:
- tactical_weight: The computed tactical weight (0.0-1.0)
- threshold: The threshold that was exceeded
- contact_ratio: Proportion of forcing moves
- delta_tactics: Change in tactical metric
