"""
Panic Move tag detector.

Detects when a player makes a move that causes a large evaluation drop
accompanied by a significant mobility loss, indicating a panicked or
poorly calculated move.

Conditions:
- delta_eval <= -2.5 pawns (large eval drop)
- mobility_delta <= -0.8 (significant mobility loss)

Evidence:
- delta_eval: Evaluation change
- mobility_delta: Change in mobility metric
- eval_drop_cp: Evaluation drop in centipawns
