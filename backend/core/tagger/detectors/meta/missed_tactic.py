"""
Missed Tactic tag detector.

Detects when a player misses a significantly better tactical opportunity,
resulting in a substantial evaluation drop.

Condition:
- delta_eval < -TACTICAL_MISS_LOSS / 100 (typically -150cp / 100 = -1.5)

Evidence:
- eval_delta: The evaluation loss
- threshold: The threshold that was exceeded
- played_move: The move that was played
- best_move: The better move that was available
